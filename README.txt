Project 2- tcp_module.cc
CS1652 Fall 2014
Due: 16 NOV 2014

Notes on the Project:
1) The files included in the zip: 
	- tcp_module.cc
	- README.txt
	(2 total files)
	
2) The Make file used was not modified in order to write this and for it to work.

3) Work Distribution:
	- We worked on every step of this project together. Many hours were spent working 
	in the networking lab testing and debugging the code. We chose to work closely in
	the design and execution of the tcp_module in order to ensure that we understood 
	the code and what was happening in its execution.
