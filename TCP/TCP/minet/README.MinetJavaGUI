MinetJavaGUI replaces the regular text-based monitoring process with a
graphical representation that tries to run in real-time.  Here is how
to use it:

1. set MINET_MONITORTYPE to javagui

1.a. You may also want to set MINET_DISPLAY to log, but it's not necessary.

2. run your Minet session - ./go.sh ... ./stop.sh

Note that MinetJavaGUI has difficulty keeping up in many situations,
in which case it makes your stack run at the speed of the GUI.
