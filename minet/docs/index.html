	<h1>Minet Documentation</h1>

	<p>
	WORK IN PROGRESS - this is a suggested skeleton for how to divide up the documentation.  There may be a good deal of overlap between the three groups, but the concerns for the three groups are (in my opinion) different enough to warrant splitting up the documentation into three parts.
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="students/index.html">For Students</a> <br/>
		A gentle introduction to Minet, the GUI tools that are available, programming/debugging techniques.  When I was in 340, I would have also appreciated some tips on how to test that we got the environment up and running correctly -- include tips on how to use nc, as well as tcp_client and tcp_server. (If wireshark is available, a brief guide on how that helps & how to use it).  Finally, make students aware of the <a href="doxygen/html/index.html">doxygen-generated documentation</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="instructors/index.html">For Instructors</a> <br/>
		A technical guide on how to set up Minet in your CS department so that students can use it (including the many options that are available: physical lab environment vs distributing Minet inside VMs). Perhaps include some suggestions for how to use Minet in the curriculum.
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="developers/index.html">For Minet Developers</a> <br/>
		Describe how to set up a good testing environment (e.g., using the VLAB, or my approach of running two instances of Ubuntu in VirtualBox), especially focusing on how to isolate Minet's network traffic (e.g., by using Host-Only networking).  Also, for starters, how to compile Minet, as well as make sense of the makefile, the setup script, etc (but wait on this, since there's a good chance all of this will change).  Document which tools are used for which aspects of the project (e.g., bug tracking, documentation, etc), what options need to be changed from the defaults, etc.
	</p>

	<p>
		Also consider linking to the tech report and the <a href="doxygen/html/index.html">doxygen documentation</a> from here.
