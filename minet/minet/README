Minet: A User-level Network Stack
=================================

Copyright (c) 2000 by Peter A. Dinda


This is a user-level network stack that is intended for use in
education.  It is not fast, but it tries to be clear and simple.  It
was developed to support an introductory course in networking at
Northwestern University, CS 340.  

More details can be found at
http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~pdinda/minet.  The first thing you
should read is the Minet technical report available at that web site.

of Computer Science Technical Report NWU-CS-02-08, January, 2002.

are mentioned in the technical report.  Items that are integrated into
the current release include:

Minet - the core distribution itself.
Minet Timeline - A post-mortem tool for looking at Minet log files.
Minet JavaGUI - A graphical interface to the Minet stack.
