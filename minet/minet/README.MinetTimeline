MinetTimeline displays the output of the monitoring process in a graphical way.  
Here is how to use it:

1. set MINET_MONITORTYPE to text 

2. set MINET_DISPLAY to log - you can do this local just to the
monitor if you'd like by editing monitor.sh.

3. run your Minet session - ./go.sh ... ./stop.sh

4. run timeline.pl
